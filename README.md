# ðŸ“Š AI Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions Dashboard

This project explores the hidden environmental cost of artificial intelligence workloads, focusing on server power usage, GPU characteristics, and global COâ‚‚ emissions. It combines real server energy data with worldwide emissions trends to showcase AIâ€™s growing environmental footprint.

Originally proposed to compare AI model energy consumption directly (e.g., GPT-3 vs BERT), the project evolved into a real-time server power analysis with machine learning prediction, using publicly available server logs and emissions datasets.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

- **Server Power Usage:** Analyzed real-time server energy (power and cumulative energy consumption).
- **GPU Metrics:** Studied GPU characteristics like TDP (thermal design power) to highlight inefficiencies.
- **COâ‚‚ Emissions:** Visualized global COâ‚‚ emission trends (2010â€“2021) to contextualize AI's indirect impact.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explored relationships between CPU load, GPU load, and total server power usage.
- **Machine Learning Prediction:** Built a regression model to estimate server power draw from CPU/GPU activity.

While the original plan to directly compare AI model training footprints (GPT-3, BERT, ResNet, etc.) was limited by dataset availability, this project successfully visualizes infrastructure-level trends and highlights key challenges for AI sustainability.

- **Cumulative Energy Usage:** Area plot showing growth of total energy consumed.
- **GPU Metrics Analysis:** Bar chart showing average GPU metrics (TDP and others).
- **GPU TDP Heatmap:** Heatmap showing GPU model vs thermal design power.
- **Global COâ‚‚ Emissions Trend:** Line chart visualizing total global COâ‚‚ emissions from 2010â€“2021.
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Heatmap exploring correlations between server power, CPU usage, and GPU usage.
- **Machine Learning Prediction Plot:** Scatter plot comparing predicted vs actual server power consumption.

## ðŸ”„ Changes from Original Proposal

- Instead of comparing deep model energy usage (GPT-3, BERT, ResNet), focused on infrastructure (server/GPU) level trends.
- Switched from a planned **world map** of COâ‚‚ emissions to a **time-series line plot** (because of dataset structure).
- Deep COâ‚‚ calculators (like DeepEn2023) were not used due to access limitations.
- Machine learning model simplified from complex deep networks to a **linear regression** approach for interpretability and simplicity.

## ðŸ”¥ Highlights

- **Interactive visualizations** using Plotly (line charts, area plots, heatmaps, bar graphs).
- **Linear regression model** predicting server energy consumption with strong RÂ² accuracy.
- **Fully styled HTML dashboard** automatically generated.
- **GitHub Pages** live hosting for easy access.
